It is a method of comparing and testing the effectiveness and benefits of two (or more) different business strategies and finding the strategy that works best. Running A/B testing helps businesses save time and money that could have been wasted if the chosen strategy didn't work. \n\nIn marketing, A/B tests can be used in many areas:\n\n* improving email open rates,\n* advertisements on social media,\n* product recommendations on your web page,\n* testing different pictures or descriptions of your product and many more.\n\n### About data\n\nA fast-food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.\n\n### Goal\n\nEvaluate A/B testing results from this dataset and decide which marketing strategy works the best and has [statistically significant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance) differences among the test groups.\n\n## Data Analysis\n\nIn this analysis, I'm going to focus on the distribution of different variables of this data set. I need to make sure that the attributes of each promotion group are symmetrically distributed so that the results of this A/B testing are fair and correct.

The t-test compares the two averages and examines whether they are significantly different from each other. \n\nThere are two important statistics in a t-test - the t-value and p-value. The **t-value** measures the degree of difference relative to the variation in the data. The larger the t-value is, the more difference there is between two testing groups. **P-value** measures the probability that the result would occur by chance. So the smaller the p-value is, the more statistically significant difference there is between two testing groups.\n\nThere is a concept of the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis. **The null hypothesis** states that the two groups show no statistically significant difference. **The alternte hypothesis** states the two groups shows a statistically significant difference.\n\n### Computing the t-value and p-value from the equations\n\nThere are three things we need to compute to ger the t-value: the mean, the standard deviation, and the number of samples.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"promo_1 <- data[which(data$Promotion==1),]$SalesInThousands\npromo_2 <- data[which(data$Promotion==2),]$SalesInThousands\npromo_3 <- data[which(data$Promotion==3),]$SalesInThousands\n\n#mean\nmean_1 <- mean(promo_1)\nmean_2 <- mean(promo_2)\nmean_3 <- mean(promo_3)\n#standard deviation\nstd_1 <- sd(promo_1)\nstd_2 <- sd(promo_2)\nstd_3 <- sd(promo_3)\n#number of samples\nn_1 <- length(promo_1)\nn_2 <- length(promo_2)\nn_3 <- length(promo_3)\n\n#t-value comparing promotion 1 and promotion 2\nt_value <- (\nmean_1 - mean_2\n) / sqrt(\n(std_1**2/n_1 + std_2**2/n_2)\n)\n#computing the degrees of freedom\ndf_1_2 <- n_1 + n_2 - 2\n#computing p-value using pt function\np_value <- 2*pt(t_value, df_1_2, lower=FALSE)\n\n#printing t-value and p-value\nprint(t_value)\nprint(p_value)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-16T13:55:00.654136Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-16T13:55:00.655794Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-16T13:55:00.709315Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We got the** t-value of 6.4275** and **p-value of 4.143e-10** (which is an extremely small number) that suggest that there is strong evidence against the null hypothesis and that the **difference between promotion 1 and promotion 2 is significant and promotion 1 outperform promotion 2**. \n\nLet's repeat the same evaluation for promotion group 1 and promotion group 3.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#t-value comparing promotion 1 and promotion 3\nt_value <- (\nmean_1 - mean_3\n) / sqrt(\n(std_1**2/n_1 + std_3**2/n_3)\n)\n#computing the degrees of freedom\ndf_1_3 <- n_1 + n_3 - 2\n#computing p-value using pt function\np_value <- 2*pt(t_value, df_1_3, lower=FALSE)\n\n#printing t-value, p-value and means\nprint(t_value)\nprint(p_value)\nprint(mean_1)\nprint(mean_2)\nprint(mean_3)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-16T14:14:00.53436Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-16T14:14:00.536329Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-16T14:14:00.578988Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here we got the t-value of 1.5560 and the p-value of 0.1205 (which is much higher than 0.05).
